                    As we move into recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that we address the underlying causes of the outbreak. These are part of a much larger systemic crisis, one in which our relationship with nature is pushing Earth’s ecological balance to the brink of collapse. From deforestation to biodiversity loss to global warming, unsustainable practices by parts of the palm oil industry have contributed to the planetary emergency we currently face.

                    <strong>With so much at stake, there is no more room for half measures.</strong> The findings of the 2021 scorecard are a stark reminder of the tremendous work that has yet to be done, and the urgency for palm oil buyers to redouble efforts to effect meaningful and long-lasting change. Despite commendable efforts by some leading companies to eliminate deforestation and conversion from their palm oil supply chains, slow action by much of the industry means that sustainability efforts drastically fall short of what is needed to counteract the ongoing damage to our world’s most vital natural ecosystems. Like many other sectors, the palm oil industry depends on nature; and yet natural ecosystems are being destroyed and degraded at a rate much faster than they can replenish themselves.

                    <strong>What our planet needs is bold and immediate transformative action by all palm oil buyers, at every level of the supply chain, and globally.</strong> While this is no small feat, the potential for swift and sustained progress across the entire palm oil industry is real. Although no company received full marks in this scorecard, a number of respondents have made momentous progress towards sustainable sourcing and sector-wide transformation in a short period of time; others are only a few steps away from becoming industry leaders who can deliver far-reaching changes. This should encourage all palm oil buyers, wherever they may be in their sustainability journey, to start this new decade of action for nature with a renewed sense of urgency and purpose.

                    <strong>Biodiversity loss is not inevitable, and WWF urges palm oil buyers to become agents of change for a nature positive world by 2030</strong> by significantly improving their score in the next year. By tackling their own supply chain risks, acting as global citizens and contributing to solutions on the ground, palm oil buyers can not only turn the tide on unsustainable palm oil — but also help reverse nature loss and safeguard the future of humanity.
