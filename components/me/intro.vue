                    The WWF Palm Oil Buyers Scorecard focuses on key actions that directly support the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and uptake of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO), and which help make the global palm oil industry more sustainable. The scorecard is divided into two major sections:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Actions that companies are taking to ensure sustainability within their own supply chain; 
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Actions that companies are taking to promote sustainable palm oil beyond their own supply chain and therefore contribute to a more sustainable palm oil sector.
