                                            Palm oil production continues to contribute to deforestation and conversion including in some of the most vitally important and biodiverse ecosystems on the planet.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In line with the Accountability Framework, WWF views certification programs and the Accountability Framework as complementary tools to define and implement ethical supply chains. Companies may purchase RSPO CSPO to fulfill key elements of the Accountability Framework. However, although all RSPO supply chain models make positive contributions to supporting sustainable palm oil production, the purchase of Mass Balance and Book & Claim credits on its own does not demonstrate that all materials in a company’s supply chain are deforestation- and conversion-free due to the presence of uncertified materials. Many companies that use certification also source non-certified materials. This may happen because certification is not available or widely used for a particular commodity or origin, or because some suppliers are early in their sustainability journey.
                                        </p>

                                            WWF therefore believes that companies should make a clear public commitment to halting conversion of all natural ecosystems, beyond deforestation only, alongside an ambitious timebound commitment to source 100% RSPO CSPO. This should cover both legal and illegal conversion, and include an explicit cutoff date after which conversion renders production areas non-compliant with the company’s commitment.

                                            Shifting supply chains to physical supplies of CSPO is important because it brings greater transparency and reduces the environmental and social risks associated with sourcing palm oil. It also requires companies to work with their suppliers and build relationships that may extend beyond a company’s own supply chain. Segregated and Identity Preserved CSPO also allows brands to show that the palm oil they use in their products is from sustainable sources.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For CPO and PKO, WWF expects companies to be able to achieve physical supply chains, and preferably source RSPO Segregated (SG) and Identity Preserved (IP) models, and thus do not award points for Book & Claim (B&C) unless it is in support of independent smallholders (IS-credits) as the purchase of these credits helps to support smallholders who may be unable or may struggle to connect to physical supply chains. Mass Balance (MB) still contains conventional palm oil that comes from unknown sources, thus MB sourcing earns fewer points compared to SG & IP.

                                            WWF also acknowledges that some types of palm oil (such as complex derivatives or volumes produced by independent smallholders) are more difficult to source from physical supplies of CSPO. This is one reason why there remains a need to have a B&C system. The latter is also valuable to ‘kick start’ transformation by making it easy and affordable for brands to support growers that are

                                            WWF recognises that many companies with headquarters in Asia and Africa are at the start of the sustainability journey and operating in emergent sustainability markets, and that it can take time to shift physical supply chains to sustainable sources. We therefore award companies points for covering their palm oil sourcing with any RSPO supply chain model, including Book & Claim. This is the only question area for which a modification to the scoring system is made for these companies.

                                            If companies are serious about ensuring supply chains are sustainable, then they need to require their suppliers to also be committed. This is particularly pertinent when supply chains are not 100% RSPO CSPO SG/IP for all types of palm oil purchased. This is also a measure that can be taken to extend influence and support for sustainable palm oil beyond a company’s own supply chain.

                                            It is important for companies to put robust systems in place to monitor and respond to non-compliance with their sourcing policies, including their commitments to source palm oil that is free from deforestation and conversion and respects human rights. Robust monitoring systems can help companies identify, mitigate, and address non-compliances with their sourcing policies.

                                            WWF recognises that monitoring for deforestation and human rights violations is complex and selecting the best systems is often company specific, depending on factors such as the range of commodities sourced by the company, the specific geography, and the company’s position in the supply chain. We also recognise that the development of robust monitoring systems is fairly recent and there is potential for rapid improvements in the coming months and years. For these reasons, and in alignment with AFi guidance, we ask companies to select or develop a monitoring system that best addresses their individual needs and risks profiles. For the purpose of this scorecard, we award full points to any company that can demonstrate they are actively monitoring for compliance with their commitments to source palm oil that is free from deforestation and conversion, and respects human rights.

                                            It is important for companies to put robust systems in place to monitor and respond to non-compliance with their sourcing policies, including their commitments to source palm oil that is free from deforestation and conversion and respects human rights. Robust monitoring systems can help companies identify, mitigate, and address non-compliances with their sourcing policies.

                                            WWF recognises that monitoring for deforestation and human rights violations is complex and selecting the best systems is often company specific, depending on factors such as the range of commodities sourced by the company, the specific geography, and the company’s position in the supply chain. We also recognise that the development of robust monitoring systems is fairly recent and there is potential for rapid improvements in the coming months and years. For these reasons, and in alignment with AFi guidance, we ask companies to select or develop a monitoring system that best addresses their individual needs and risks profiles. For the purpose of this scorecard, we award full points to any company that can demonstrate they are actively monitoring for compliance with their commitments to source palm oil that is free from deforestation and conversion, and respects human rights.

                                            Commitments made by companies are typically aimed at mitigation of deforestation risk, rather than at the critical need for reducing deforestation. It is imperative that commitments are pro-environment, addressing past, current and potential future deforestation and conversion caused byperverse market signals. Commitments must also be pro-sustainable, removing barriers to broader market transformation, including the barriers that exist in production landscapes. It is for this reason that WWF has included questions in the Scorecard that reach beyond a company’s “own supply chain” and introduce a greater element of “shared responsibility” to this end.

                                            Similarly, the Accountability Framework expects that “companies contribute to sector, landscape, and jurisdictional initiatives to foster collaboration towards addressing key social and environmental challenges” under Core Principle 10.

                                            WWF expects companies that are serious about sustainable palm oil to join the RSPO and participate in other action-oriented sustainable palm oil platforms. These “platforms” need to go beyond just membership and commitments on paper and must require demonstrable action and implementation by participating companies beyond their own supply chains.

                                            <strong>Supporting smallholder producers</strong><br>
                                            Smallholders play a critical role in the production of palm oil, producing some 40% of global production, and inclusion of these producers in ethical supply chains is essential to help support livelihoods in rural communities, increase agricultural productivity, avoid displacement of social and environmental impacts, and secure stable commodity supplies. However, inclusivity of smallholders in sustainable supply chains continues to be challenging, thus WWF recognises efforts by companies to this end. WWF recognises this separately in the Scorecard via Independent RSPO CSPO Smallholder credits, and under this question is looking for additional on-the-ground actions to support smallholder’s inclusivity that is linked to sustainability.

                                            <strong>Biodiversity conservation and restoration</strong><br>
                                            One of the key principles of sustainable palm oil production is restoration. In particular, landscapes and degraded ecosystems – including forests,
