                    Palm oil buyers continue to fall short of implementing the necessary transformative actions needed to halt the destruction of the world's most crucial forests and natural ecosystems. Despite efforts, companies are only averaging a score of 14.7 points out of 24. This score underscores the significant distance that remains for these companies to demonstrate a genuine commitment to establishing palm oil supply chains that are devoid of deforestation, ecosystem conversion, and human rights abuses.

                        While some companies exhibit leadership in sustainability, the overall pace of action within the industry remains slow, hindering efforts to counteract the ongoing damage caused by unsustainable palm oil production. Additionally, a considerable number of companies refrain from disclosing information about their palm oil usage and sustainability efforts, which limits transparency and accountability in the sector. This highlights the need for greater collaboration and transparency to address sustainability challenges effectively.

                        The urgency for action within the palm oil industry has never been greater. Unsustainable practices have fueled biodiversity loss, deforestation, and climate change crises. With ambitious targets and pathways for conserving and restoring biodiversity over the next decade and beyond, there's a clear mandate for accelerated corporate action. Palm oil buyers must translate promises into tangible measures to address these pressing issues. Time is of the essence, and the planet cannot afford further delays.
